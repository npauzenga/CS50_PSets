0.  "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" is our 45-letter, max-length for words 
    we intend to spell check.
    
1.  getrusage()will return metrics on system resources. If we call it using RUSAGE_SELF,
    it will return stats on the calling process. It will output to the struct pointed to
    by the second parameter
    
2.  There are 16 variable in the rusage struct

3.  Do we pass in references to before and after (instead of values directly) for efficiency's
    sake?
    
4.  main() uses fgetc, char by char until EOF is reached, the word is too long,
    or a number is found. If any of those things happen, we finish scanning the line
    and start a new word (using index to indicate whether we have completed a word or not).
    Otherwise, the char is added to the word in progress. We then check if the word is finished,
    and spell check it.
    
5.  One potential reason to use fgetc over fscanf would be that fscanf could consume
    a word that is too long and therefor overflow our word[].

6.  Const will prevent changes to the object pointed to. word and dictionary.

7.  I used a hash table with separate chaining via linked-lists. 

8.  .78 seconds on the Austin Power test.

9.  Still need to figure out why the checker is dragging. Likely due to unsorted lists.

10. It needs to be tuned and optimized further. Just getting the data structure to work was
pretty big.
